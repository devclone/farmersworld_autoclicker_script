# Important note
After game update (if it happens) this script won't work because of 3D version of the game!  The only way out is to use bots.  Me and my friend made simple bot witch runs on YOUR LOCALHOST.
  You can check all info here - https://github.com/Splash-07/fw-bot  Bot works ONLY with **tools**. Because of problems with CPU impossible to test 10+ tools + animals + farm plot without enough stacked WAX for CPU.

# farmersworld_autoclicker_script
Autoclicker (script) to Mine, Claim, Repair and restore Energy for NFT Game (https://farmersworld.io/).
Its free and 100% safe. You can check all code by yourself.

## About scripts

There are two files **farmersworld_default.js** and **farmersworld_with_members_cards.js**.
1) If you don't have member cards or you want to claim everytime the claim is ready - choose **farmersworld_default.js**
2) If you have member cards and you want to reduce CPU usage -  choose **farmersworld_with_members_cards.js**.  **VERY IMPORTANT NOTE** - for parameter **'const minAmountOfEnergy ='** in .js file you need to set value equal of your highest tool energy requirement * quantity of stored mines. For example, you have Mining Excavator and two silver member cards. To mine your resources you need minimum 133 * 5 = 665 energy. So you need to set parameter **const minAmountOfEnergy = 665** otherwise you will never claim you resources!!!

## How to use it

- Go to https://farmersworld.io
- Login to the game
- Press F12
- Find and click 'Console' tab
- Copy and paste the code from **farmersworld_default.js** or **farmersworld_with_members_cards.js** file to console and then press 'Enter'
- To stop the code you need to refresh the page (F5)
