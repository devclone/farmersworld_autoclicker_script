# farmersworld_autoclicker_script
Autoclicker (script) to Mine, Claim, Repair and restore Energy for NFT Game (https://farmersworld.io/).
Its free and 100% safe. You can check all code by yourself.

## About scripts

There are two files **farmersworld_default.js** and **farmersworld_with_members_cards.js**.
1) If you don't have member cards or you want to claim everytime the claim is ready - choose **farmersworld_default.js**
2) If you have member cards and you want to reduce CPU usage -  choose **farmersworld_with_members_cards.js**.  **VERY IMPORTANT NOTE** - for parameter **'const minAmountOfEnergy ='** in .js file you need to set value equal of your highest tool energy requirement * quantity of stored mines. For example, you have Mining Excavator and two silver member cards. To mine your resources you need minimum 133 * 5 = 665 energy. So you need to set parameter **const minAmountOfEnergy = 665** otherwise you will never claim you resources!!!
